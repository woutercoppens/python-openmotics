Asynchronous Python client for the OpenMotics API.

## About

An asynchronous python client for the OpenMotics API to control the outputs.

This library is created to support the integration in
[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io).

## Installation

```bash
cd python-openmotics
pip install .
```

## Usage

```python
import pyopenmotics

om_cloud = BackendClient("client_id", "client_secret")
om_cloud.get_token()

installs = om_cloud.base.installations.all()
for install in installs:
    print("- {}".format(install))
print(install["id"])

outputs = om_cloud.base.installations.status_by_id(install["id"])
print(outputs)
```

## Changelog & Releases

This repository keeps a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on
[Keep a Changelog][keepchangelog].

Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the format
of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. In a nutshell, the version will be incremented
based on the following:

- `MAJOR`: Incompatible or major changes.
- `MINOR`: Backwards-compatible new features and enhancements.
- `PATCH`: Backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates.

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

This Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependency
manager. But also relies on the use of NodeJS for certain checks during
development.

You need at least:

- Python 3.8+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]
- NodeJS 12+ (including NPM)

To install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
npm install
poetry install
```

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
